This includes for instance if the data are acquired and primarily stored in a profile or centroid mode. An explicit text description of the acquisition process is also desirable. This includes the acquisition sequence (for instance as simplified as top-five method with a cycle made of one full MS1 scan in the Orbitrap, followed by a precursor selection of 5 most intense ions applying an exclusion window of 30 seconds and followed by the acquisition of 5 product ion scans generated in the LTQ analyzer, and detected in the LTQ). This allows to differentiate between the use of a selected precursor window vs unselected fragmentation (MS`E/bbCID/AIF). This also allows to explicitly describe pre-defined the acquisition method of a SRM experiment where all transitions and detection windows are specified."
