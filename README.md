## STATegraEMS, the Experiment Management System

**STATegra EMS** is an _Experiment Management System_ (EMS) for omics experiments that supports different types of sequencing-based assays, proteomics and metabolomics data. We specifically support experiments such as RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, Chip-seq, Methyl-seq, or DNase-seq and can easily be extended to support additional sequencing assays. The system has been developed to provide research laboratories with an integrated system that offers a simple and effective way for experiment annotation and tracking of analysis pipelines from raw data to ready-to-use measurements, using free, open source software technologies.

**STATegra EMS** has been developed by the [Genomics of Gene Expression Lab](http://bioinfo.cipf.es/aconesawp/) at [Príncipe Felipe Research Centre](http://www.cipf.es/).
